When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When colaborating or working on a project at multiple sites.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you only add relevant/commits you want to make public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks begin new repo (often from other user when using their work as starting) with link to old but no longer impacting.
Clones are a copy of files and repo with commit history (when sharing with a colaborator on same project).
Branches cause a new path/line of commits which can (implementation of a new feature or expirimental change).
